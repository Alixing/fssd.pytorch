Official caffe implementation is [here](https://github.com/lzx1413/CAFFE_SSD/tree/fssd), and pytorch0.3 re-implementation is [here](https://github.com/lzx1413/PytorchSSD). For details, please read the paper: 
  [FSSDï¼šFeature Fusion Single Shot Multibox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00960v1)
  
Our re-implementation is slightly better than paper(79.73 vs 78.8). More high performance models will be available soon. 

##About more details
+ After feature layers fusion, I don't employ a BN layer, which is different with paper
+ Because the limitation of amount of gpu, batch_size is set to 32. If use 64 or more, I believe it will produce better performance
+ The code is mainly based on [RFBNet](https://github.com/ruinmessi/RFBNet). If you are interested in this project, please email me([yhao.chen0617@gmail.com](yhao.chen0617@gmail.com))
